An email sender makes your life easier and your sent emails look more professional,
its main purpose is to personalize your sent emails by sending one email at a time and wit the 
receiver name.

there are other alternatives like MailChimp, but it's not free, and for small list of emails 
this works perfectly.

**you have to have a Google developers app running for this to work**
- you need to fill in the emails txt file with format as Email:name
- you need to edit the body txt file to have the first line as the title, and the second line as the greetings without the name, as it will added automatically, if you have any attachments you can add them instead of the image. 
- finally it will print out a list of emails and names to be sent to, and will ask you to confirm.
